# OceanDAO Seed Grants Portal

### FAQ
Q: What is Seed? Why do I need to use it?<br/>
A: Seed is the portal for how all projects inside of OceanDAO submit to receive a grant.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Can't I just post a proposal or reply to Port?<br/>
A: No. This was an old way of doing things and we're improving the grants program so participants can self-serve more easily.<br/>
<br/>
Q: How can I log into the portal?<br/>
A: We have used the Funding Wallet that you have submitted in the past, and used that as your Admin Wallet. You can [find all of this information inside of our Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrd5s7HSXc2vC1iC)<br/>
<br/>
Q: How can I write a good proposal?<br/>
A: [Please look at our old proposal page to learn how to write a proposal](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal)<br/>
<br/>
Q: Can I change my Admin Wallet?<br/>
A: Yes, please follow these steps:<br/>
1. Please reply to your latest proposal inside https://port.oceanprotocol.com/, with the 0x address you want to use.<br/>
2. Tag us @ ocean-dao-engineering, and share the link to your post inside of https://port.oceanprotocol.com/.<br/>
3. We'll update your records, so you can access your project and proposals.<br/>
4. Please note that we need to verify your proposal is completed before you can apply for the next round.<br/>
<br/>
